## Part 1: App Description

> Please provide a friendly description of your app, including the app
> category that you chose, and the primary functions available to users
> of the app.

PONG Arcade Game. This game is made to resemble the friendly, and familiar
    PONG game. The user uses a mouse and the paddle (left side) is set to follow the
    cursor. Score points by beating your opponent by moving the paddle to bounce the
    ball off. The ball is set to change speed as it hits the paddle, and the direction
    of the ball starts at random and moves accordingly. First one to 3 wins!

## Part 2: New

> What is something new and/or exciting that you learned from working
> on this project?

Instead of using the traditional VBox and HBox configurations that we were
    used to set up our game, I introduced myself to Canvas and GraphicContext.
    In addition, the overall thinking was super exciting. This includes trying
    to figure out how to make borders and bouncing off the paddles, as well as
    making new text appear based off the score of the game.

## Part 3: Retrospect

> If you could start the project over from scratch, what do
> you think might do differently and why?

When doing this I worked very sporatically and attempted to complete many different
    things simultaneously. If I were to start from scratch, I would commit to making
    the different GraphicsContext strokes first based off score dependencies. After that,
    I would transition to the overall functionality of the game. In addition, and if granted
    more time I would like to work more with the random function, so that I can make not only
    the AI miss randomly, but make the bouncing of the ball more random too.
